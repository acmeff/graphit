# Graphit

[Go to live site][heroku]



Graphit is a data visualization application inspired by [Chartio][chartio]. It allows users to upload and save data, which they can then easily turn into visually-pleasing graphs and charts.

## Main features

### Upload & save data sets

Graphit supports uploading csv files and saving the data for future use. As the files are uploaded, they are parsed into JSON to be stored in the database.


Any files that are added by a user can be accessed and viewed from that user's account. The JSON data is retrieved from the database and displayed in a table for the user to see.

### Generate data visualizations

Saved data sets are used to create charts and graphs, which can then be saved and shared.
A graph can be created from any one of the user's uploaded data sets. Once they have selected a data set to work with, the data from that table is retrieved from the database and returned as a JSON object.

![create graph](https://github.com/acmeff/graphit/blob/master/graphit/docs/screenshots/create-graph.png "Creating a new graph based on user's data set")

The graphs are generated by manipulating the JSON data based on the user's input. Information from the input fields is passed to the preview component, which also has access to the JSON table data that has been returned from the database. Depending on what inputs the user selects (i.e., which pieces of data to use to populate the x-axis of a bar graph), the preview component assigns the correct values to the chart generator.

Once the initial graph has been generated and displayed, the user may toggle between formats (and data sets) and view their changes before saving the graph.

Types of charts available:
+ Line graphs
+ Bar graphs
+ Area graphs
+ Spline graphs
+ Pie charts
+ Donut charts

When saved, graphs are stored in the database with a reference to the table that was used to create it, along with information about the specific format of the graph, so that it can be easily re-created at a later time. All saved graphs may be displayed by retrieving this information from a logged in user's account. At this point, graphs may also be shared with other users.

## Technologies & Dependencies

Graphit is built with Ruby on Rails, React/Redux, and PostgreSQL.

  + Data visualization uses [C3.js][c3]
  + CSV to JSON parsing uses [PapaParse][papaparse]
  + Uploading files uses [react-drop-to-upload][droptoupload]
  + Formatting html tables uses [react-json-table][jsontable]

## Future features

Next steps for Graphit include implementing the following:

 + Editing graphs
 + Supporting additional data types for upload
 + Creating graphs using multiple data sources
